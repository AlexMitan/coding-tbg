1) Nonpropagation conditions
    Messages have a non-propagation condition for nodes:
    AoE attack from (0, 0): do not propagate if (node.type == 'tile' and node.distanceFrom(source) > 1)

2) ListensTo
    Nodes listenTo event types by processing and/or propagating them downwards.
    Adding a child makes nodes above it listenTo what it listensTo.
    Removing it causes a recalculation of listenTo for parents.

 - Should items always remove themselves from their parent before removing themselves via remove()?
 - Dead flag + cleanup vs direct removal?
 - removeChild - should it nullify the parent field?
 - addchild - should it set the parent field?
 - addToParent etc: should parents be replaced and auto-removed on replace?
